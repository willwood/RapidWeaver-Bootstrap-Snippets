	<content type="html">&#60;!-- Use the &#39;Preview ExtraContent Containers&#39; option in the theme Miscellaneous style settings to see where each container is located. Drop this code snippet into any styled text or HTML code area in your page content or sidebar region. Change the number referenced in the code snippet (e.g. 6) to match the number of the ExtraContent container you want to target. Replace the &#39;Hello World&#39; test with your content. Please note that in some RapidWeaver themes, certain ExtraContent containers need to be enabled in the theme settings, before they show. --&#62;
