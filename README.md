# RapidWeaver Bootstrap Snippets
## Introduction

[Twitter Bootstrap](http://http://getbootstrap.com/) has grown quickly in recent years to become a powerful front end framework for the construction and deployment of modern, responsive websites. [ThemeFlood](http://themeflood.com) was the first addon company to pioneer the use of Bootstrap in RapidWeaver themes. 

To make things easier for people new to the idea of Bootstrap code in RapidWeaver, a selection of installable code snippets were developed. These are provided for free and allow users to drag and drop particular Bootstrap components into a page. 

These Bootstrap code snippets can be used in any RapidWeaver page style, within either styled text or HTML code regions of a page. Code and content within the snippets is fully accessible, and this aids the setup and customisation of the Bootstrap elements.

## System requirements
These code snippets require a RapidWeaver theme which is advertised as having support for **Bootstrap**. The snippets will often fail to work in themes not having support for Bootstrap at all. You can download or purchase Bootstrap compatible themes from the [ThemeFlood website](https://themeflood.com).

## Installation and usage
The snippets can be downloaded by navigating to the official repository on Github:
[https://github.com/willwood/RapidWeaver-Bootstrap-Snippets](https://github.com/willwood/RapidWeaver-Bootstrap-Snippets)

On that page, you should see a button at the top or in the sidebar with an option to download the complete repository. Typically this is marked as **Download ZIP** or similar. The repository consists of this *README.md* markdown file and all of the latest RapidWeaver Bootstrap code snippets available.

Alternatively, the code snippets are available using the download links provided on the [ThemeFlood](https://themeflood.com) website.

Once downloaded, you will typically have a folder containing a **readme.md** file (the same one you are reading right now) and a bunch of several dozen code snippets. Double-clicking on these snippets will install them into the RapidWeaver addons folder, in the **Snippets** sub directory.

After installation, you will find that the snippets are all available for use in the **RapidWeaver Snippets** window (View > Show Snippets or CMD + 5). Click on one of the listed code snippets and drag it into your page (when RapidWeaver is in edit mode).

All of the Bootstrap code snippets are prefixed *bootstrap-* so they should be sorted into a single group and won't disorganise other snippets you already have installed. Of course you have complete freedom to edit any of the snippets or delete ones you are not using. You can also search for snippets or rename them.

## Support
The official [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) website has working examples of many of the Bootstrap components and details of what they do; plus lists of customisable variables which might be available to you.

RapidWeaver Bootstrap snippets tend to include a title and brief comments relating to setup and usage in the top of the snippets. These comments will include any important information you need to know about.

The [ThemeFlood Knowledgebase](https://themeflood.com/knowledgebase/) has a whole chapter dedicated to the use of Bootstrap in ThemeFlood RapidWeaver themes. If you need help with using a ThemeFlood theme, then you can also get in contact via [the website](https://themeflood.com/support).

## Contribute
The [RapidWeaver Bootstrap Snippets](https://github.com/willwood/RapidWeaver-Bootstrap-Snippets) project is very much a community-led project and actively encourages input from any interested individuals or companies.

If you have created new RapidWeaver Bootstrap snippets that you feel would appeal to other users and you want them distributed via this repository, please forward them to me via email or commit them to the repository via Git.

## Getting updates
The easiest option is to clone this repository in software like SourceTree or GitHub Desktop via the following link:

	https://github.com/willwood/RapidWeaver-Bootstrap-Snippets.git
	
When new commits are made, you 'll get notification of these and details about what has changed. 

The other option is to just periodically download the snippets and overwrite the ones you already have installed with the latest ones in the package.

## Old Bootstrap 3 snippets
These are archived in a folder marked **Old Snippets For Bootstrap 3**. Many of these snippets are unlikely to work with Bootstrap 4. We provide them for the benefit of people using older themes and still needing access to Bootstrap 3 code snippets.

The RapidWeaver Bootstrap Snippets are dual licensed under [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and [GPL-v3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). This grants you almost complete freedom to download, modify and redistribute any of the snippets, plus the ability to bundle them as part of other projects or to resell them.
